# Global-Video-Games-Sales

<b> Analysis of Global Video Games Sales</b>

In this project I explore the the sales of video games across the globe using different attributes of the games, such as genre, rating, and review score. The purpose of this project is to examine the factors that lead to a game having high sales, and to determine whether or not review scores or popularity matter more for the sales of a game.
