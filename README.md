# Global-Video-Games-Sales

<b> Analysis of Global Video Games Sales</b>

In this project I explore the the sales of video games across the globe using different attributes of the games, such as genre, rating, and review score. The purpose of this project is to examine the factors that lead to a game having high sales, and to determine whether or not review scores or popularity matter more for the sales of a game.

### Tech Stack
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Python
- Plotly
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

# Summary
I chose to do this project because I like playing games and am interested in whether or not reviews really matter in determining the sales of a game. These days many games are sold as a pre-order package before the game is actually out so people buy games before they even know if they are good or not. 

First, I took the top publishers because they are the ones that usually use the pre-order system the most.
